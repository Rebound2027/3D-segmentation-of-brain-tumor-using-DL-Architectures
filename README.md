Brain Tumor Segmentation using BraTS-Africa Dataset

A biomedical deep learning project focused on accurate brain tumor detection and segmentation using the *BraTS-Africa dataset*. This project implements multiple neural network architectures and innovative data augmentation and compression techniques for optimized and efficient model performance.


Project Overview

This project aims to develop robust deep learning models to segment and predict brain tumors using MRI scans from the BraTS-Africa dataset. We explored and compared three leading segmentation architectures — *VNet, **UNet, and **SegNet* — to evaluate accuracy, generalization, and computational performance.

In addition to model experimentation, we introduced novel optimization techniques including:

- *Strassen Matrix Multiplication* in place of traditional convolution operations for computational efficiency
- *Huffman Coding* for compressed storage and deployment of model weights

Key Features

- Multi-model segmentation using *VNet, **UNet, and **SegNet*
- Dataset sourced from *BraTS-Africa* (MRI brain scans)
- Efficient convolution approximation using *Strassen Matrix Multiplication*
- Model compression with *Huffman Coding*
- Evaluation based on Dice Score, Precision, Recall, and IoU
